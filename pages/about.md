I'm a sofware engineer from Greece, currently living in London and working at
[Habito](https://www.habito.com/). I have a degree in engineering from the
National Technical University of Athens. I currently write Haskell at work (and
home). I am interested in software, type theory, formal verification and emacs.
After 6pm I also play guitar (mostly jazz) and the oud.

In this site you can also find a [list of some of my projects](/lists/projects.html)
and a [list of talks I have given](/lists/talks.html).
