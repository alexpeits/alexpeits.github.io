title: About
---

I'm a software engineer from Athens, Greece, currently living and working in
London. Some of my interests include functional programming (mostly Haskell),
type systems, domain design, infrastructure (terraform) and formal verification
(Coq).

When not smashing on a keyboard, I also play guitar (mostly jazz) and the
[oud][oud].

Things I use:

- [emacs][emacs.d]
- [Nix / NixOS][nixos-config]
- [xmonad][dot-xmonad]

This site is built using Haskell, [Pandoc][pandoc] and the [Shake][shake] build
system, and it is of course [open source][site-source]. The idea and much of the
code was taken from [Mark Karpov][mark-karpov]'s site.

In this site you can also find a [list of some of my projects][projects] and a
[list of talks I have given][talks].
