I'm a sofware engineer from Greece, currently living in London and working at
[Sohonet](https://www.sohonet.com/). I have a Master's degree in engineering from the National
Technical University of Athens.
I currently write Python at work, but outside of work I write mostly Haskell.
I am interested in writing good software, algorithms, type theory and of course
[Emacs](https://github.com/alexpeits/emacs.d).
By night, I'm also a jazz guitarist.

You can find me at

and by email at `alexpeitsinis [at] gmail [dot] com`.
