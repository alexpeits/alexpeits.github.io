title: About
---

I'm a sofware engineer from Greece, currently living in London and working at
[Habito](https://www.habito.com/). I have a Master's degree in engineering from the National
Technical University of Athens.
I currently write Haskell & Purescript at work (and home).
I am interested in good software, algorithms, type theory and of course
[Emacs](https://github.com/alexpeits/emacs.d).
By night, I'm also a jazz guitarist.

You can find me at
